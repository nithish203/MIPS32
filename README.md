# MIPS32
  The given verilog code is not a exact implementation of the processor. But a subset of the instructions of the MIPS32 Processor.
  The MIPS32 is a 32 bit processor. It is a 5 stage pipelined processor. There are registers between the pipeline to store the previous value.
  
## Stages of Pipeline
### 1. Instruction Fetch
### 2. Instruction Decode
### 3. Execte
### 4. Memory 
### 5. Register Write Back
